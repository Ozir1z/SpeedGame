# SpeedGame

SpeedGame is inspired by the 1994 film Speed, where Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are stuck on a Bus with a bomb that will explode if they go under 50MPH. the goal
of this prototype was for me to get familiar with Unreal Engine, C++ and the Chaos Vehicle plugin. At first I just wanted to create a simple road generator that would
endlessly generate road and have a bus where the player has to maintain speed in order to get the best score. But it tunred out to be a bit more than that, I added AI
with different speeds, a custom skybox and futuristic (Tron) inspired road.

I decided I wanted to "finish" the game so I added sound effects, a proper menu with sound options and some constrol options. I also added options for the player to change
the color of the road and skybox.

Settings use UEs GameUserSettings and the score is saved with UEs SaveGame, so that settings are saves are loaded when the game is restarted.

It's not the most complex code, but it was a fun little project.

Feel free to fork this, I won't be adding any more features or fixing any bugs. I won't be dealing with PRs either.
